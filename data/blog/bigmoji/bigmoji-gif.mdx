- GIFing it up with BigMoji
- How do I GIF?
  - The previous implementation used [gif.js](https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js) and [gif.worker.js](https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.worker.js) by [jnordberg](https://github.com/jnordberg) and [gif-frames.js](https://github.com/benwiley4000/gif-frames) by [benwiley4000](https://github.com/benwiley4000).
- If (see when) we turn this into an APi with a NodeJS backend Sharp would actually take care of everything.
