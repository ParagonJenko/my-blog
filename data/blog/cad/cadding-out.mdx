What is Computer Aided Dispatch?

- A method of dispatching people (taxis, couriers, emergency services) to a location/event.

Why this project?

- I did some roleplaying for a group in GTA that also involved me being the "dispatcher" and it was really interesting.

The uses for this?

- Fun really, it'd need much more stringent work to be deployed professionally.

The requirements:

- An event needs to be generated, either externally or by a user.
- Users need to access the event.
- The events need to be displayed in real-time.
