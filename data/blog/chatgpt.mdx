Why ChatGPT saved my life...ish.

How I use it:

- Prompts:

  - provide a title and one line summary
  - provide me the title in lower case, with hyphens between each word with no symbols
  - improve the below blog post to be more fun while remaining technical in markdown

- I've asked it to explain code to me or to identify causes of errors.
